Big Store: Stop the page from scrolling!

User story #1. I'm confronted with a 4x4 table. If I move my finger up or
side-way, the page doesn't move with it.

User story #2. I tap on each cell, it becomes green. If I tap again, it 
becomes white.

User story #3. If I move around my finger, I can make all cells that it 
has gone through green, or white based on the starting color. 

Result: store #1 is done.
